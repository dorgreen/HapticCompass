# HapticCompass
Arduino project for HapticCompass belt

Using a compass to trigger the north-most haptic engine once in X seconds, with proper power-saving sleep in between.
Using a 1000mhA 5V portable charger and 4 button-sized haptic engines on an Arduino Nano V3 I was able to run it for 20 hours.

This code assumes using a HMC5883 compass and accelometer chip. I used a genreic one and it worked well.
For correct North, declinationAngle should be changed to match your position on the globe.
the array action[] holds the output pins the engines are connected to. you could use any number of outputs. they are ordered from north clockwise.
